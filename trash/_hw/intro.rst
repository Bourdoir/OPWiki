Introduction
------------

OpenPilot flight hardware is designed to be extremely flexible and to perform
to the highest standard. There has been a massive amount of attention put into
its details. Nothing in OpenPilot has been created in a vacuum - a great deal
of research has been done so that the platform is both cost-effective and
future proof.

Performance
-----------

OpenPilot is designed from the ground up to be a UAV platform for rotary and
fixed-wing vehicles. The hardware architecture enables us to use the 32-bit
180 MIPS of processing power very effectively. It is designed so that it's an
extremely flexible platform. OpenPilot is designed to support any NMEA GPS
unit, so as the state of the art changes, these newer GPS solutions can be
used instantly.

A complete OpenPilot-based system will typically look like the diagram below:
