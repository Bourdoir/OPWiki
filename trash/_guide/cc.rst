=========================

Setting up your CopterControl Board for the first time.
-------------------------------------------------------

These notes cover both CopterControl (CC) and CopterControl3D (CC3D) boards.

.. note:: Follow the :doc:`/hw/cc` for detailed instructions about how to
   mount the board in your Vehicle.
   
Once your board is mounted in the Vehicle, proceed to the :doc:`/sw/gcs` page.

For your convenience, the two videos below demonstrate how to set up a basic
quadcopter as your vehicle.

The videos are now a little outdated but remain a valuable reference. The GCS
has had numerous upgrades since they were prepared.
