.. warning:: **OPENPILOT WAS DISCONTINUED!**

   Use `LibrePilot <http://www.librepilot.org/>`_ instead.

We've designed this section and the OpenPilot/LibrePilot Documentation as a whole to flow
like a story, guiding you through all the steps necessary for successful setup
and flight.

New users will use this section to learn the basics of the system and progress
to their first flight, while experienced users can refresh their memory when
setting up a new board, or gain insight into more detailed functions and
configurations covered in the advanced sections of the manual.

As a new user, try to take things one step at a time, take advantage of video
tutorials where available, and follow the manual in sequential order. We've
provided links to the previous page, next page, and Table of Contents whenever
possible to simplify navigation as you progress through the manual.

Let's get started!
